# Therapy Chatbot

The Therapy Chatbot is a Python-based chatbot that provides a conversational interface for users to discuss their feelings and receive appropriate responses. It uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and deep learning to understand user input and generate relevant replies.

## Features

- Interactive chat-based interface
- Uses a trained model to predict user intents
- Provides appropriate responses based on predicted intents
- Supports multiple intents and responses
- Easily extensible with additional intents and responses

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Keras (with TensorFlow backend)

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it by sending messages. The chatbot will analyze your input, predict the intent, and respond accordingly. You can customize the intents and responses by modifying the `intents.json` file.

Example

Here's an example interaction with the chatbot:
```shell

User: Hello
Chatbot: Hi there, how can I help you today?

User: I feel sad
Chatbot: I'm sorry to hear that. Remember that it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Is there anything specific that's bothering you?

User: Yes, I lost my job
Chatbot: Losing a job can be tough. Take some time to process your emotions and consider exploring new opportunities. It's important to stay positive.

User: Thank you for the advice
Chatbot: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further support, feel free to ask.

User: Goodbye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Take care of yourself. Remember, I'm here to help whenever you need someone to talk to.
```
